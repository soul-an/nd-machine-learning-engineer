# Dog Breed Classifier

In this project, I learned how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm would identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

### The Road Ahead

- Step 0: Import Datasets
- Step 1: Detect Humans
- Step 2: Detect Dogs
- Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
- Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
- Step 5: Write My Algorithm
- Step 6: Test My Algorithm

### Tools used on this project

- **Jupyter notebook**, an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text
- **PyTorch**, an open source machine learning library
- **OpenCV**, an open source computer vision and machine learning software library
- **Matplotlib**, an open source plotting library
- **NumPy**, an open source library which adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices
