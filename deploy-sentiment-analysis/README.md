# Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model

In this project,
-   I constructed a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set by using Amazon's SageMaker service.
-   In addition, I deployed my model and constructed a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.
